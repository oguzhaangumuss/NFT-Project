# Main NFT Project
I initiated and managed the entire project. I took on critical software tasks such as NFT production and deployment to the blockchain. I developed a website that allows users to purchase NFTs and established the technical infrastructure. Additionally, I managed the project's social media presence, building and growing the community on platforms like Discord and Twitter.

Main offers a unique experience in the NFT world, promising exciting rewards and special privileges to its users. The project's first NFT collection, "Eternal Remains," features 7 unique coffins, each offering special privileges based on the different levels of ownership.

In this project, I leveraged my technical expertise and social media management skills to pioneer innovative applications of NFT and blockchain technologies.

Project details:

NFT production and blockchain integration
Development of a website for NFT purchases
Community management and growth on Discord and Twitter
Reward and privilege systems for community members
I am proud to have brought this project to life, starting a new era in the NFT world with Main!
